**HttpYac (ZW edition)** is a command line tool and Node.js library for running requests written in `.http` and `.rest` files. It supports HTTP/REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, MQTT, AMQP and Kafka. You can send a single request, run a whole folder of files in CI, and add scripts and assertions for tests.

This edition is a fork of [httpyac](https://github.com/AnWeber/httpyac) by [Andreas Weber](https://github.com/AnWeber). It adds features and ships fixes that are not in an upstream release yet. Most of this wiki is adapted from the upstream docs at [httpyac.github.io](https://httpyac.github.io/) (MIT licensed). Sections that differ from upstream are marked with a **ZW edition** note.

> [!NOTE]
> **ZW edition:** adds the `QUERY` method, the Kafka protocol, file comparison asserts (`matchesFile`, `matchesJsonFile`), a reworked Server-Sent Events client, and upstream fixes that were never released to npm. See [ZW edition differences](ZW-Edition-Differences).

## Quick start

```shell
npm install -g @zerowiggliness/httpyac
httpyac --version
```

Create `example.http`:

```http
@user = doe
@password = 12345678

GET https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/{{user}}/{{password}}
Authorization: Basic {{user}} {{password}}

?? status == 200
```

and run it:

```shell
httpyac send example.http
```
